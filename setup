These are setup instructions for running on macOS Big Sur. I don't have any extra machines to test a new installation with, so YMMV.
These are also very rudimentary installation instructions. If you know how to manage virtual environments and things... um... that I guess. 
No warranties or guarantees here, etc. etc. 

——————— Install————————

Download or clone the repository. 

Check if you have python 3 installed. In Terminal, type: 
python3

If it's installed, you'll enter the python interpreter. You can exit that with Control + d. If not, you may be prompted to install Command Line Tools as promoted by macOS. Do that. 

Install required packages using the following commands:
pip3 install nltk && pip3 install guizero && pip3 install feedparser && pip3 install pygame

Install language processing data from nltk with the following command:
python3 -m nltk.downloader popular

To run the program, type:
python3 /path/to/directory/goes/here/main.py
