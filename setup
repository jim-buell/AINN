These are setup instructions for running on macOS. I don't have any extra machines to test a new installation with, so YMMV. 

Download or clone the repository. 

Check if you have python 3 instlled. In Terminal, type: 
python3

If it's installed, you'll enter the python interpreter. You can exit that with Control + d. If not, you may be prompted to install Command Line Tools as promoted by macOS. Do that. 

Install required packages using the following command:
pip3 install nltk && pip3 install guizero && pip3 install feedparser

Install language processing data from nltk with the following command:
python3 -m nltk.downloader popular

To run the program, type:
python3 /path/to/directory/goes/here/InfiniteScroll2/main.py
