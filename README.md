Contemporary political and cultural opinion is increasingly driven through emotional reactions to often-dubious, context-free information. Financial incentives on the Internet and on social media mean that the information that gets promoted is that which best drives “engagement.” Emotion — particularly outrage — is a powerful driver of engagement, and media companies seeking views see few downsides in promoting rage-inducing material even when that information contains no truth nor value to society.

If generating outrage is more valuable than reporting truth, media companies will soon adopt tools designed to most efficiently generate rage-inducing content. XYZ is such a tool.

XYZ is designed to create an endless stream of news-like information that is specifically tuned to elicit emotional reactions. Though the system writes about people and events currently in the news, the content is created through a simple algorithm that has no notion of truth. 

The device itself employs graphics and technology reminiscent of the early days of the Internet. Such a tool doesn’t rely on complex, modern artificial intelligence. Its simple programing could have existed when computer networks first emerged. It isn’t modern technology driving our addiction to dubious information and partisan rhetoric; it’s our human desire to react to anything sensational.

All the information is false, but if it makes us engaged, do we even care?
