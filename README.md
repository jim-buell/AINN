The short version:
This is a dumb AI that makes dumb news headlines via GUI-based output. 

And here’s the pretentious version:
Contemporary political and cultural opinion is increasingly driven through emotional reactions to often-dubious, context-free information. Financial incentives on the Internet and on social media mean that the information that gets promoted is that which best drives “engagement.” Emotion — particularly outrage — is a powerful driver of engagement, and media companies seeking views see few downsides in promoting rage-inducing material even when that information contains no truth nor value to society.

If generating outrage is more valuable than reporting truth, media companies will soon adopt tools designed to most efficiently create rage-inducing content. The AI News Network is such a tool.

AI News Network is designed to produce an endless stream of news-like information that is specifically tuned to elicit emotional reactions. Though an Internet connection allows the system to write about people and events currently in the news, the sentences are randomly created through a simple algorithm that has no connection to reality. 

The device itself employs graphics and technology reminiscent of the early days of the Internet as the tool doesn’t rely on modern technology like machine learning. Its simple AI can hardly be called intelligent and could have existed when computer networks first emerged. It isn’t modern technology driving our addiction to dubious information and partisan rhetoric; it’s our human desire to react to anything sensational.

All the information from the AI News Network is false, but if it engages us, do we even care?
